MASM x86

A few examples of MASM x86 Projects


# Project 1
 Description: Write and test a MASM program to perform the following tasks:

1. Display your name and program title on the output screen.
2. Display instructions for the user.
3. Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
4. Calculate the sum, difference, product, (integer) quotient and remainder of the numbers.
5. Display a terminating message.

# Project 2
Description: Write a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
1. Display the program title and programmer’s name. Then get the user’s name, and greet the user.
2. Prompt the user to enter the number of Fibonacci terms to be displayed. Advise the user to enter an integer in the range [1 .. 46].
3. Get and validate the user input (n).
4. Calculate and display all of the Fibonacci numbers up to and including the nth term. The results should be displayed 5 terms per line with at least 5 spaces between terms.
5. Display a parting message that includes the user’s name, and terminate the program.

# Project 3
 Description:
1. Display the program title and programmer’s name.
2. Get the user’s name, and greet the user.
3. Display instructions for the user.
4. Repeatedly prompt the user to enter a number. Validate the user input to be in [-100, -1] (inclusive).
		Count and accumulate the valid user numbers until a non-negative number is entered. (The non-
		negative number is discarded.)
5. Calculate the (rounded integer) average of the negative numbers. 6. Display:
	i. the number of negative numbers entered (Note: if no negative numbers were entered, display a special message and skip to iv.)
	ii. the sum of negative numbers entered
	iii. the average, rounded to the nearest integer (e.g. -20.5 rounds to -20)
	iv. a parting message (with the user’s name)
